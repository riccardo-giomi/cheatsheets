Test prescriptions
==================

1. Use the TDD process to create and adjust your code's design in small,
   incremental steps.

2. In a test-driven process, if it's difficult to write tests for a feature,
  strongly consider the possibility that the design of the underlying code
  needs to be changed.


Words to live by
================

* Any change to the program logic should be driven by a failed test.

* If it's not tested, treat it like it's broken.

* Testing is supposed to help for the long term. The long term starts tomorrow,
  or maybe after lunch.

* It's not done until it works.

* Tests are code that doesn't have tests; keep them simple.

* Start a bug fix by writing a test.

* Tests monitor the quality of your codebase. If it becomes difficult to write
  tests, that often means your codebase is too interdependent.
