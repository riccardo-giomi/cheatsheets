# Clean code: origins and definitions

## 5S

In about 1951, a quality approach called Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) came
on the Japanese scene. Its focus is on maintenance rather than on production. One of the
major pillars of TPM is the set of so-called 5S principles:


### 整理 Seiri

(sorting, arrangement, organization, putting in order, adjustment, regulation)

Organization (think "sort" in English).
Knowing where things are -- using approaches such as suitable naming -- is crucial.

### 整頓 Seiton

(orderliness, put in order, tidying up, arranging neatly)

Tidiness (think "systematize" in English).
A piece of code should be where you expect to find it -- and, if not, you
should re-factor to get it there.

### 清楚 Seiso

(neat and clean, tidy, trim)

Cleaning (think "shine" in English):
keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waste.
What do the authors here say about littering your code with comments and
commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for the future?
Get rid of them.

### 清潔 Seiketsu

(clean, hygienic, sanitary)

Or standardization: the group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean.
Have a consistent coding style and set of practices within the group.

### 躾 Shitsuke

(discipline, training, teaching manners)

Discipline (self-discipline).
This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently
reflect on one's work and be willing to change.
